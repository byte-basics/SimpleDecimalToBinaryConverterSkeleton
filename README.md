# SimpleDecimalToBinaryConverterSkeleton

This is basic skeleton code for the optional decimal to binary converter problem set as problem 2 in the Decimal to Binary worksheet (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1293SPGvMzVCOQWPBO6Bv_XdlujCqTc8f/view?usp=sharing) for worksheet). 
Changes should be ,ade to the DecimalConverter class so that all unit tests pass.
